== Epilog

Epilog is a simple log viewing application written in Ruby on Rails, 
and a log aggregator written in Ruby. It uses Ferret, a Ruby port of 
the Apache Lucene indexer and search engine, and the acts_as_ferret 
Rails plugin to provide fast searching  of rfc3164 formatted log files.

Simply put, Epilog makes viewing near real time logs through a web 
interface quick and easy. 

== Where stuff is

The rails viewing bits exist under rails/
The aggregator code exists under aggregator/

A symlink of the rails databases.yml is made to the aggregator
directory so database settings are shared.
