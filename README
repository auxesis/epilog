== Epilog

Epilog is a simple log viewing application written in Ruby on Rails, 
and a log aggregator written in Ruby. It uses Ferret, a Ruby port of 
the Apache Lucene indexer and search engine, and the acts_as_ferret 
Rails plugin to provide fast searching  of rfc3164 formatted log files.

Simply put, Epilog makes viewing near real time logs through a web 
interface quick and easy. 

== Where stuff is

The rails viewing bits exist under rails/
The aggregator code exists under aggregator/

A symlink of the rails databases.yml is made to the aggregator
directory so database settings are shared. 

== Requirements

We use a whole bunch of libraries. It's probably a good idea
to have rubygems installed. Gems (probably) required are:

 - ferret (should be frozen in Epilog's rails app)
 - acts_as_ferret (should be frozen in Epilog's rails app)
 - active_record (frozen in Epilog's rails, but required by the aggregator)
 - term/ansicolor
 - fileutils

== Usage

For testing and development:

To aggregate and index data locally:
 - make sure aggregator/database.yml is pointing to a usable database
   $ $editor aggregator/database.yml
 - for production usage, set RAILS_ENV to "production"
   $ export RAILS_ENV="production"
 - start the aggregator 
   $ ruby aggregator/aggregator-local.rb <logfile>

To start the rails app:
 - start webrick/lighttpd, by running
   $ rails/script/server 

To start up the log writing simulator:
 - the logfeeder reads data from an existing logfile, and outputs 
   lines to stdout at random intervals. this roughly simulates real 
   mailserver logging behaviour. 
 - make sure you have some test data to play with (testdata.log for example)
   $ ruby aggregator/tests/scripts/logfeeder.rb testdata.log > <logfile>
   then point the aggregator at the <logfile>

== TODO
 - properly daemonise the aggregators
