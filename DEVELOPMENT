== Storage backends

Some crafty refactoring has made it really easy to write 
different storage backends.

A storage backend is used by passing it to the watcher (it's probably
going to have some settings set before you do this). The watcher will 
break up lines and pass them as a 'data' object to the storage object 
with a @storage.commit. 

To write your own storage mechanism, just make sure your class
has a commit method that accepts a hash. 

An interesting storage mechanisms would be something that turns the
hash into a yaml fragment, and every 10 or so fragments does a http
POST. This would be the beginnings a remote watcher/central aggregator
system.
